## Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working in a middle school as a psychological counselor.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Lifelong Learning and Adult Education in Kocaeli University. Also I am very curios about software and AI!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on usage of artificial intelligence tools in education.

- ⚡ Not-so-Fun fact: I try to learn too many thing at once and I had mediocore success in all of them. An advice for the person who reads this: Focus on a single thing at a time, become a master of that thing and you will have great success. Good luck!
