## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in a middle school as a psychological counselor.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Lifelong Learning and Adult Education in Kocaeli University. Also I am very curios about software and AI!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on usage of artificial intelligence tools in education.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to psychology.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: swordofhorizon@gmail.com
- âš¡ Not-so-Fun fact: I try to learn too many thing at once and I had mediocore success in all of them. An advice for the person who reads this: Focus on a single thing at a time, become a master of that thing and you will have great success. Good luck!
